## Abstract
Since the dawn of the digital age, the challenge involved in the storage and manipulation of data has always been a topic of prime importance and interest for humankind. This is essentially due to the fact that the digital data collected, processed and retrieved acts as the operational lifeline for all the people, businesses and governments that rely upon it. The aforementioned challenge has been addressed in numerous appropriate ways over the years based on the then prevalent technologies and solutions. All such technologies have had their own advantages and disadvantages. One such solution that exists today is the distributed key value storage systems, which tend to be highly scalable, reasonably efficient and offer better availability which renders them highly favourable to store big data. In this project we shall explore this topic further in order to build our own version of a distributed key value storage system, extend its functionality and consequently evaluate its performance. We shall also discuss about its strengths and weaknesses, as well as some possible enhancements that could be implemented in the future.
